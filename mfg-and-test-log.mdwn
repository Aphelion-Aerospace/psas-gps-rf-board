# Manufacturing and Test Log

### ~ 2014/06/05: Bring up

- Initial bring up ~ 
- R38/R39/R40 TOTALLY WRONG - LED way to bright
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PE2 (pin 1, also TP1) to U3 (PHY chip) pin 23 (LED0) in order to engage PHY chip's debug features
- FIXED: Misunderstood PHY error, so made Kenney reflow U3 (PHY) for no reason.
- FOUND: PCB mfg error right at pad of pin 12 (RXD1) on U3 (PHY). Trace was "pinched off", NC to pad.
   - FIXED: Kenney scraped back solder mask and added short mod wire to bridge pad and trace.
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PB10 (pin 47) to U1 (MAX) pin 9 (SCLK), also cut trace between 0.1 holes.
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PB15 (pin 54) to U1 (MAX) pin 8 (SDATA), also cut trace between 0.1 holes.
