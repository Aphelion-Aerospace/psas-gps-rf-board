# Manufacturing and Test Log

### 2015/04/28: jGPS v3 Board #1

- Brought up board #1!
- BUG: C77 should go from U14 MIC5319-1.8V BYP to GND, ***not*** Vout. I blame society.
- BUG: C77 should be 100n, not 10n
- BUG: C76 should be 2.2uF, not 1.0uF
- FUTURE: Ground clip pads should be bigger, what about a ring around the whole board.
- BUG: U13 should be a **XC2C64A** not a XC2C32A.
- FUTURE: FTDI cable or similar connector for COTS chip so we can program it directly from a PC.
- FUTURE: jumper to hold the STM in reset.
- FUTURE: zero ohm resistors (or cutable enable lines) in each power supply so we can shut them off if we want to.

### ~ 2014/06/05: Bring up

- Initial bring up
- R38/R39/R40 TOTALLY WRONG - LED way to bright
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PE2 (pin 1, also TP1) to U3 (PHY chip) pin 23 (LED0) in order to engage PHY chip's debug features
- FIXED: Misunderstood PHY error, so made Kenney reflow U3 (PHY) for no reason.
- FOUND: PCB mfg error right at pad of pin 12 (RXD1) on U3 (PHY). Trace was "pinched off", NC to pad.
   - FIXED: Kenney scraped back solder mask and added short mod wire to bridge pad and trace.
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PB10 (pin 47) to U1 (MAX) pin 9 (SCLK), also cut trace between 0.1 holes.
- MODWIRE: U2 (STM32) PB15 (pin 54) to U1 (MAX) pin 8 (SDATA), also cut trace between 0.1 holes.

### ~ 2014/05/20: Stuffed Board #1 

- Board #1 (out of 3) stuffed on ~ 2014/05/20 by Jenner.
   - LNA not stuffed: U5, L2, L5
- Configuration:
   - C24 (sch:down/brd:left), C22 (sch:down/brd:left), C19 (sch:left/brd:left), which is the "straight through to LNA1 configuration"
   - LNA 

### 2014-04-04: Board manufacturing

- Sent to OSH Park on 2014/04/04 as a four layer board.
