jGPSv3 board #3
===============

Buid date: Friday, June 19, 2015
Primary builders: Kenny and Andrew

## Issues
* 0 satellites in view (software-correlator)
* Venus hot/warm start super-cap is draining too quickly
* LED2,4,5,7 are way too dim
* LED6 dim

## Assumptions
* The sky is broken

## Modifications
* C77 - ns
* U9 - Venus 8 (support airborn mode and faster refresh)
* R22 - pull-up after programming Venus 8 (to boot from flash)
* C24 - 1uF (wait longer for stable power before Venus startup)
* R24 - 100 ohm (charge supercap faster)
* R18 - add 100nF to GND (stablize !RST on the STM32)
